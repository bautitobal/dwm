# Bauti Tobal's dwm
A **custom build of dwm** (Dynamic Window Manager) with a minimal aesthetic inspired by *Detective Conan* with a Nord palette.
This setup focuses on **simplicity**, **speed**, and **workflow efficiency** (for my own use case), bringing some Hyprland-style keybinds and scripts.

## Features
- Minimalist visual style
- Custom scripts integration (`zen-mode`, `wallpaper selector`, etc.)
- Multimedia keys (volume, brightness, player controls)
- Screenshot shortcuts
- Vim-like navigation

## Keybindings overview
TODO.

## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/bautitobal/dwm.git
cd dwm

# Build and Install
sudo make clean install
```

> Requires xorg, make, and gcc to be installed.

### Dependencies
- `rofi`: App launcher (you can use dmenu instead)
- `dmenu`: Minimal app launcher (suckless philosophy)
- `kitty`: Terminal emulator
- `thunar`: File manager
- `brave-bin` & `librewolf-bin`: Web browser
- `brightnessctl`, `playerctl`: Audio & brightness control

## Philosophy

> "Minimalism is not about removing features - it's about keeping only what empowers your workflow."

## Credits
TODO.
